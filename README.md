# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
This study guide was created for bootcamp students who, like me, are going through their prework. It holds some of my notes on the subjects talked about throughout the prework, such as HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.
